You can't acess the repo for some reason when it is on heroku

so you should copy code to github when you are done

(not quite, this copies heroku remote too... manually copy all files...)
cp -r knight-rises/* knight-rises-code-github/

gitc "added code"
gitp


# for 3d open gl
    pip install numpy
    pip install pygame
    pip install opengl
or maybe
    sudo apt-get install python-opengl
or something similar

On windows it will be much harder
