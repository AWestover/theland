You can't acess the repo for some reason when it is on heroku

so you should copy code to github when you are done

cp -r knight-rises/* knight-rises-code-github/

gitc "added code"
gitp


# for 3d open gl
    pip install numpy
    pip install pygame
    pip install opengl
or maybe
    sudo apt-get install python-opengl
or something similar

On windows it will be much harder
