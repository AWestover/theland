<h1 class="well well-lg">The Land</h1>
<h2 class="well well-lg">Information about the game</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
The goal of the game is to get the most animals
Move arround the board by scrolling with your finger or mouse or tilting your moblie device if it has an acceleromter
attack other players in order to harm them and get stormlight for defeating them
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Currency</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
The currency in this game is "stormlight"
If you get stormlight you can buy an animal. You can't buy any more once you are at 15 animals, but they may reproduce still.
(as of now you cannot manipulate gravity once you attain stormlight.
This feature would be cool, but probably is not feasible to add without support from NASA)
animals will grow and reproduce (and sometimes get sick and die as dictated by the cycle of life)
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Age</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
This is how old your animal is.
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Strength</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
This is how much damage you do.
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Hunger</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
If you get too hungry you will die. Feed your animals!
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Speed</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
Faster animals move faster...
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">User stats</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
You chose a name, a world and some other stuff too.
Sorry but I don't allow names longer than 15 characters
they will be truncated if they are too long
also world names are subject to this constraint
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">How does the currency work?</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
You have a somewhat steady (yet slightly random) constant income source
Click on the buy button to get an animal in the current center of your screen
this costs 100 stormlight for now
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Winning and losing</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
Look at the leaderboard to see your score your score
is determined mostly by how many animals you are fielding
but other factors like stormlight contribute to your score as well
see the scoreboard by pressing Toggle Scores
for your current standing.
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">What is my score?</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
In general this is your score:
<pre>
function getScore()
{
  return Math.floor(this.personals.length*20+0.1*this.stormlight);
}
</pre>
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Food</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
Eat food. It is good for you
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Predators</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
These will eat YOU. They will also destroy food, but they can only eat humans.
If you eat one you get boosted, which on the first time it happens will double your health
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Toggle Attract</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
your animals may be attracted to the center if you want
which gives a higher chance of level up, but you gain stormlight faster
if you have this off...
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Border</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
You know that big red rectangle arround the perrimeter of the map?
Don't step on it.
Really, I am not sure why you would want to.
It will kill you. I am very sorry for the inconvenience.
</p>

<h2 class="well well-lg">Terrirories</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
You lose health if you enter someone elses territory, and gain strength if you visit yours.
</p>
