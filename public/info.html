<h1>Information about the game</h1>
<p>
The currency in this game is "the knight"
If you get knights you can buy an animal
animals will grow and reproduce (and sometimes get sick and die as dictated by the cycle of life)
the goal of the game is to get the most animals
good luck

Move arround the board by scrolling with your finger or mouse

attack other players in order to harm them and get knights for defeating them

</p>

<h2>How does the currency work?</h2>
<p>
You have a somewhat steady (yet slightly random) constant income source
Click on the buy button to get an animal in the current center of your screen
this costs 100 knights
</p>

<h2>Winning and losing</h2>
<p>If you run out of animals you lose. If you have the most animals your are in the lead!
see the scoreboard by pressing Toggle Scores
for your current standing
</p>

<h2> New Feutures on the way </h2>
<p>
This section will soon be put in to place
(that is a pretty good new feature and thus a contradiction.... I am deeply sorry for this apparent paradox)
