<h1>The Land</h1>
<h2>Information about the game</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
The currency in this game is "stormlight"
If you get stormlight you can buy an animal
animals will grow and reproduce (and sometimes get sick and die as dictated by the cycle of life)
the goal of the game is to get the most animals
good luck

Move arround the board by scrolling with your finger or mouse

attack other players in order to harm them and get stormlight for defeating them

</p>

<h2>How does the currency work?</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
You have a somewhat steady (yet slightly random) constant income source
Click on the buy button to get an animal in the current center of your screen
this costs 100 stormlight for now
</p>

<h2>Winning and losing</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
Look at the leaderboard to see your score your score
is determined mostly by how many animals you are fielding
but other factors like stormlight contribute to your score as well
see the scoreboard by pressing Toggle Scores
for your current standing.
</p>

<h2>What is my score?</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
In general this is your score:
<pre>
function getScore()
{
  return Math.floor(this.personals.length*20+0.1*this.stormlight);
}
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
Eat food. It is good for you
</p>

<h2>Predators</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
These will eat YOU. They will also destroy food, but they can only eat humans.
If you eat one you get boosted, which on the first time it happens will double your health
</p>

<h2>Toggle Attract</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
your animals may be attracted to the center if you want
which gives a higher chance of level up, but you gain stormlight faster
if you have this off...
</p>

<h2>BORDER</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
You know that big red rectangle arround the perrimeter of the map?
Don't step on it.
Really, I am not sure why you would want to.
It will kill you. I am very sorry for the inconvenience.
</p>

<h2>Terrirories</h2>
<p class="well well-lg">
You lose health if you enter someone elses territory, and gain strength if you visit yours.
</p>

<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
