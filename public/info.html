<h2>Information about the game</h2>
The goal of the game is to get the most animals
Move arround the board by scrolling with your finger or mouse or tilting your moblie device if it has an acceleromter
attack other players in order to harm them and get stormlight for defeating them
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
<p id="hotkeys">
Well here they are I guess
</p>
<script>
titles = ["Key", "Action"];
keys = ['b','t','c','arrows or awsd', 'g', 'h', 'f', 'u', 'r', 'l'];
responses = ['Buy', 'toggle attract', 'togle scores', 'move view', 'toggle stats selection',
'annihilate (only if cheating)', 'feed  selected', 'upgrade selected', 'freeze if cheating', 'user.stormlight+=100 if cheating'];
data = [ keys, responses];
$('#hotkeys').append(arrayToTable(titles, data));
</script>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Currency</h2>
<p>
The currency in this game is "stormlight"
If you get stormlight you can buy an animal. You can't buy any more once you are at 15 animals, but they may reproduce still.
You can also buy food for animals, or upgrade animals.
(as of now you cannot manipulate gravity once you attain stormlight.
This feature would be cool, but probably is not feasible to add without support from NASA)
animals will grow and reproduce and eventually become old and die. So it goes.
You have a somewhat steady (yet slightly random) constant income source
Click on the buy button to get an animal in the current center of your screen
this costs 100 stormlight for now
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Age</h2>
<p>
This is how old your animal is. This affects the rate of change of your health due to age, and the rate of change of your speed.
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Strength</h2>
<p>
This is how much damage you do.
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Hunger</h2>
<p>
If you get too hungry you will die. Feed your animals! (costs 10 stormlight)
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>
Faster animals move faster... This is affected by age a bit.
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>User stats</h2>
<p>
You chose a name, a world and some other stuff too.
Sorry but I don't allow names longer than 15 characters
they will be truncated if they are too long
also world names are subject to this constraint
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Winning and losing</h2>
<p>
Look at the leaderboard to see your score your score
is determined mostly by how many animals you are fielding
but other factors like stormlight contribute to your score as well
see the scoreboard by pressing Toggle Scores
for your current standing.
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>What is my score?</h2>
<p>
In general this is your score:
<pre>
function getScore()
{
  return Math.floor(this.personals.length*20+0.1*this.stormlight);
}
</pre>
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>
Eat food. It is good for you. Pizza gives 10 health for now.
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Predators</h2>
<p>
The dinos. These will eat YOU. They will also destroy food, but they can only eat humans.
If you eat one you get boosted, which on the first time it happens will double your health
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Toggle Attract</h2>
<p>
your animals may be attracted to the center if you want
which gives a higher chance of level up, but you gain stormlight faster
if you have this off...
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Border</h2>
<p>
You know that big red rectangle arround the perimeter of the map?
Don't step on it.
Really, I am not sure why you would want to.
It will kill you. I am very sorry for the inconvenience.
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-lg">
<h2>Terrirories</h2>
<p>
You lose health if you enter someone elses territory, and gain strength if you visit yours.
