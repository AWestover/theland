Basic game mechanics

Collision boxes work

April 25
death mechanics

NOTE CURRENTLY NOT USING Personal, Prey, Predator Classes
not sure when they will be integrated... they make it confusing. I don't want to duplicate code...

May 5th

Need to add food

also note: users are not sending out the amount of knights that they have which leads to leaderboard problems

also, it might be good to have a cheat where I can kill the other player...
something like send an attack to all animals...

attacks should draw knights...



Slight collision detection error I think....



TODO:

efficient collision checking

Predator and prey npcs

Animals need to satisfy hunger too

IF mouse Animal collision show animal full stats



if you use it in browser on a phone, it will be annoying
later try to make it better: ie make reload harder, no scrolling etc

Sunday TODO list

Kill your own animals optional (I DUNNO ABOUT THIS ANYMORE...)
kill other animals then get reward should be added (NEEDS TO BE FIXED...)
check food collisions
need health
check mouse animal collisions and show stats (only mouse pressed so Maybe different)

Monday:
improve stuff
ask around for ideas

Also note the predators are a little bit broken
A little bit fixed

rotate animals to correct direction (add rotation tracker, adjust when ever xvel sign is out of sync)
WORKS

Gain health and get boosted if you kill a predator
WORKS

if multiple logins and logouts it sometimes messes up user.th
example: login 2 ppl. then logout the one with user.th=0; then login another guy
I'm pretty sure that you now have 2 ppl with th=1;
WORKS


Future:

random population boom for animals (why? / needs to stop...)

collisions are a little bit broken... (why / when?)

Boundary is a bit off... (why, needed calibrations?)

Do NOT allow animals to overlap

make the circles kill animals if they go in the wrong one

Better gametree collision detection (faster quadtree)

Animals have lots of stats and you can breed them


Stuff can spawn on top of other stuff
