Basic game mechanics

April 24
Collision boxes work

April 25
death mechanics

NOTE CURRENTLY NOT USING Personal, Prey, Predator Classes
not sure when they will be integrated... they make it confusing. I don't want to duplicate code...

May 5th

Need to add food

also note: users are not sending out the amount of knights that they have which leads to leaderboard problems

also, it might be good to have a cheat where I can kill the other player...
something like send an attack to all animals...

attacks should draw knights...



Slight collision detection error I think....



TODO:

efficient collision checking

Predator and prey npcs

Animals need to satisfy hunger too

IF mouse Animal collision show animal full stats



if you use it in browser on a phone, it will be annoying
later try to make it better: ie make reload harder, no scrolling etc

Sunday TODO list

Kill your own animals optional
kill other animals then get reward should be added
check food collisions
need health
check mouse animal collisions and show stats (only mouse pressed so Maybe different)

Future

score board is weird sometimes
Boundary is a bit off...
Do NOT allow animals to overlap
make the circles kill animals if they go in them

Better gametree collision detection (faster quadtree)

if multiple logins and logouts it sometimes messes up user.th
example: login 2 ppl. then logout the one with user.th=0; then login another guy
im pretty sure that you now have 2 ppl with th=1;

rotate animals to correct direction

Monday:
improve stuff
ask around for ideas

Also note the predators are a little bit broken
