Collision boxes work

death mechanics

NOTE CURRENTLY NOT USING Personal, Prey, Predator Classes
not sure when they will be integrated... they make it confusing. I don't want to duplicate code...

May 5th

Need to add food

also note: users are not sending out the amount of knights that they have which leads to leaderboard problems

also, it might be good to have a cheat where I can kill the other player...
something like send an attack to all animals...

attacks should draw knights...



Slight collision detection error I think....



TODO:

efficient collision checking

Predator and prey npcs

Animals need to satisfy hunger too

IF mouse Animal collision show animal full stats



if you use it in browser on a phone, it will be annoying
later try to make it better: ie make reload harder, no scrolling etc

Kill your own animals optional

kill other animals then get reward should be added
