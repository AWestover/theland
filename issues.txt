Issues:

need to add cancellation for the logout timer thing

I am worried that deaths are being overcounted.... especially personals....

boosted animals can stay back to guard territory

add the ability to destroy territory by occupying it, and lessen territory occupation consequences
(ie health drop) also give the stormlight of the killed user to whomever kills them

expand map as more users join

return users can buy upgrades to their animal

return users have a fixed animal type
